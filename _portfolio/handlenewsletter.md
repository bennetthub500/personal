Newsletter announcing new features and soliciting new beta participants for an email, to-dos, and calendar app. 

A PDF of the actual newsletter is [here.](https://github.com/bennetthub500/personal/blob/master/assets/images/Handle%20newsletter%20sample.pdf)  The below text is identical except for a few images and HTML styling for MailChimp.

Dear Clients,

Team Handle has been hard at work on two major improvements: inbox loading performance (done) and our next-generation mobile experience (coming soon.)

To help usget our next-gen mobile app across the finish line, we're looking for a few mobile mavens who love giving feedback and promise not to leave their iPhone at the bar.  If interested, please signup here. 

And thank you for all the thoughtful feedback on multiple accounts last month - we love hearing about features in action. 

Best, 
Shawn Carolan, CEO, Handle

**Email Signatures**<br/>
Highly requested (thank you, Jon, Bob, Mike, and others!) and now delivered: a unique email signature for each of your accounts.  Find it under the "Settings" gear icon. 

**Your Inbox, Faster**<br/>
If you have the need for speed, smile.  We've improved the way Handle fetches email from the Gmail server so that it's even more responsive, especially at login time. 

**iOS Beta Trial**<br/>
To apply, please click here.  We're very grateful to have clients who are so eager to provide feedback and solve their email overload once and for all. Thank you Vytenis, Mike, Jason, Chris, and 33 others for accelerating this on the roadmap.
