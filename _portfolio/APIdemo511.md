title: "API documentation demo"
---

This is a demo of REST API reference documentation using the Open API v3.0 spec.

Open API spec v3.0 (formerly known as Swagger) is the leading spec format. API reference docs can be published in responsive, modern themes that can be used off-the-shelf or customized. These sites allow developers to make calls and view the response.

This [demo example](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/bennetthub500/511v2/1.0.0) uses Swagger's own publishing offering in the SwaggerHub platform. I took two endpoints from 511.org's API and implemented them in the Open API spec.
