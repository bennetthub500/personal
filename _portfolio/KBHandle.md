Freshdesk Knowledge Base Content for Handle mobile app

The content is a mix of support instructions, with occasional context about how the app, based on productivity best-practices, can change the user’s daily email, to-do and calendar tactics.

**Usage:**  Published in Freshdesk knowledge base, and also utilized as canned answers to email support questions.

**User profile:** early adopter, tech-savvy consumers that were harvested from Handle’s Tech Crunch Disrupt launch and semi-private beta campaigns.

**Challenge:**  As always - to get users to change ingrained behaviors.


**Why am I asked to let Handle know my location? What does location do?**

Sometimes you need to be reminded to do something when you’re in a certain place, like knowing to run an errand when you are home, or deposit a check when you are near a bank. Handle’s location-based reminders let you set any to-do or email to remind you this way, so you can get the right work done at the right place and time.  You can set a location-based reminder the same way you set a time-based reminder - except on the first screen where you are presented with time categories such as 'this morning', 'this afternoon' etc, change the "When" selection at the top of the screen to "Where."  Then follow the steps to either create a location or use an existing one.


**What does archive do?**

When processing your inbox, we recommend archiving, rather than deleting, all emails you want to clear out of your way because archiving permits them to always be recovered through a search in Gmail (search inside Handle is coming soon!). All archived emails can also be viewed in your Gmail All Mail folder. The key difference is that once an email is deleted, it’s gone forever.


**What is Read Later?**

Read Later is for emails that you don’t need to act on now, are low priority, and therefore ones for which you won’t create a to-do or reminder. Read Later gives you a way to clear them from your inbox but always find them later by going to the ‘Read Later’ label, or by searching for them.   Here's how you can remove an email from Read Later: In your desktop Gmail, go to the Read Later label, and remove the label. If you remove both the Read Later label and the Handle label, the email will still be recoverable in your All Mail folder.


**Can I turn on push email notifications?**

Handle is working to break the habit of being constantly reactive to the inbox, so we are launching without notifications for individual emails. If this type of notification is important to you, we’d love to know - you can contact us by going to the Handle side panel > Support > Send Feedback.


**How do I delete Handle?**

Sorry to see you go! To delete Handle, simply delete the app.  It’s possible that one notification may come up after you delete, but they will stop after that.  You may notice that Handle created folders in your Gmail account - you can delete those manually, since Handle no longer touches them.

Handle stores none of your email and to-do data, so there's no trace left.

To delete Handle calendars, launch the Calendars app on your iPhone or iPad.

Tap on Calendars at the bottom > Edit > Select calendar to be deleted > tap delete calendar > tap on delete calendar again on the popup.  On your computer, in your Gmail/Apps accounts, go to calendar, calendar settings, and delete the Handle Due Date calendar in each by clicking 'unsubscribe.'
