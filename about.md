I write for a broad range of audiences, including developers, users, and customers. I love working across teams, including sales, product, design, UX, marketing, engineering.  I have an obsession with detail and process that is a great fit with engineers.  

API documentation is my next frontier, because I enjoy technical challenges. A demo is shown here using Github-based publishing. 

The customer-facing work I've done helps me be a better technical communicator. I have managed the customer-to-product team feedback loop, performed customer development interviews, and co-developed user journeys and prototypes. My previous writing efforts were in the fields of community relations, PR, and marketing.
