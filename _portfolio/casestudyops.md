## OpsTechnology Community Profile

Global Gate Controls, a supplier of more than 500 models of gate and garage remotes and access cards, is using OpsTechnology to establish credibility with potential customers, increase sales, and achieve significant marketing hours savings. Although Global Gate is a successful and growing company, it faced challenges common to small suppliers in the multi-family housing industry: high marketing costs due to staff turnover at management companies, as well as difficulty in overcoming the resistance of remote staff to working with new vendors.

**Joining the OpsTechnology Supplier Community**

Global Gate joined the OpsTechnology Supplier Community, which includes the top vendors in the multifamily industry, and after only a few months determined that more management company staff now recognized the company. This has created new opportunities for Global Gate to market to more of its customers’ properties.

“Being part of the Ops community gave us credibility and familiarity,” said Jim Fuqua, President of Global Gate Controls.  “When property managers are ready to make a purchase, we’re now validated because we've been invited by the management company to participate. First they look at us – and they often start buying.

We have significantly improved customer retention and penetration since we became an Ops vendor.  As a small firm, it’s had a major impact in reducing my workload because at any moment we could lose 15% of our business with a particular manager due to turnover. I constantly had to run reports of who was buying. For anyone who dropped off the list, we had to go back and re approach the property, and if it's a new manager we were usually back to square one. This used up many hours of my time, and now it’s a thing of the past.”

**The Payoff: Improved Productivity for Management**

Improved customer retention and penetration have saved Global Gate a significant amount of advertising dollars, as well as a minimum of 10-15 hours a month in marketing efforts.
Another clear benefit of being an Ops vendor is the improved cashflow and reduced hours needed for collection calls because of the vastly increased reliability of the automated payables system.  “A large problem with AR is that something will not make it through from the point of purchase to point of payment,” said Fuqua. “Paper gets lost or misplaced, or errors get made. Now, we almost never have this problem. We’re saving 5-10 hours every week by not having to make collection calls.”
