title: "API documentation demo"
---

This is a demo of REST API reference documentation using the Open API v3.0 spec.

Open API spec v3.0 (formerly known as Swagger) is the leading spec format. API docs can be published in responsive, modern themes in static site generators that can be used off-the-shelf or customized.  These API docs when published will allow developers to make calls and view the response.  In this sample you can authorize and call. 

This [demo example](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/bennetthub500/511v2/1.0.0) uses Swagger's own publishing offering in the SwaggerHub platform. I took two endpoints from 511.org's API and implemented them in the Open API spec.
