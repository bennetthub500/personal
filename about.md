A cross-functional collaborator

I write developer documentation but I also have experience writing for a broad range of audiences. I love working across teams, including sales, product, design, UX, marketing, and engineering.  I have an obsession with detail and process that is a great fit with engineers.  

The customer-facing work I've done helps me be a better technical communicator. I have managed the customer-to-product team feedback loop, performed customer development interviews, and co-developed user journeys and prototypes. My previous writing efforts were in the fields of community relations, PR, and marketing.
