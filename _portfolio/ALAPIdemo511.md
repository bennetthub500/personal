title: "API documentation demo"

A demonstration of REST API documentation and publishing using the Open API v3.0 spec 

You can view two versions of this self-created writing sample:

1) [Stoplight](https://bennett-charles.stoplight.io/docs/511api-demo/branches/main/mfrt8ye1a09uh-using-the-511-org-api), with a more-readable, contemporary 3-panel design.

2) [Swaggerhub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/bennetthub500/default-title/0.1), an older interface design with a working Try-it feature where the reader can make a live API call.

- This API example brings an under-documented public API up to current standards for API docs. 
- I implemented three endpoints in the OpenAPI spec from the API of 511.org, a San Francisco Bay Area transit organization. 
- I created an abbreviated developer guide or quick start with code samples, procedural instructions and some partial reference content.

My current API documentation experience is with material covered by an NDA that can't be shared. 

**Note:** This demo was created by me without the assistance of any subject matter experts at 511.org.
