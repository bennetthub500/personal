Key API docs copy for developer experience 

Wrote API field descriptions which are exposed in developer environments and the documentation feature of the GraphQL API explorer.

**Project context:** As a technical writer on Amazonâ€™s Developer Experience team on a 3-month contract, I was tasked with rewriting multiple onboarding and API docs.

**Problems to solve:** Existing GraphQL API field descriptions were absent or inadequate, and naming was often not obvious. 

**Process for this document:**  Collaborated with engineering and product to determine the friction points in understanding these not-obviously named fields, and added essential information about type, values and use cases.  This involved discovering design docs and numerous 1-on-1 conversations with engineers from other teams. 

**Audience:** The audiences for the onboarding docs are internal Amazon engineers and third party developers.
