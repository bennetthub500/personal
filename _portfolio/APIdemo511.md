title: "API documentation demo"
---

This is a demo of REST API reference documentation using the Open API v3.0 spec using Swagger. 

The content is located in a YAML file and is hosted on SmartBear's Swaggerhub website.   

The [demo example](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/bennetthub500/511v2/1.0.0) allows the reader to make API calls and view the response on the web page. I took two endpoints from 511.org's Bay Area Rapid Transit API and implemented them in the Open API spec, with brief instructions for authentication.  

This demo was created by me without the assistance of anyone at 511.org or Bay Area Rapid Transit.
