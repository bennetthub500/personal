Copywriting - Hubspot marketing campaign landing pages 

Here are two landing pages for Personas, a B2B sales automation platform that targets startups. 

The audience for the [first piece](https://bennetthub500.github.io/personal/pdfs/PersonasFoundersLanding2.pdf) is founders and heads of sales, and the [second piece](https://bennetthub500.github.io/personal/pdfs/PersonasMktgLanding3.pdf) is aimed at marketing leads.  

The stylistic goals for both were brevity, with punchy language, a crisp definition of benefits and deliberate repetition.
