title: "API documentation demo"
---

This is a demonstration of REST API documentation and publishing for public transit data using the Open API v3.0 spec. 

The [demo example](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/bennetthub500/511v2/1.0.0) allows the reader to make API calls and view the response on a web page. I took two endpoints from the API of 511.org, a San Francisco Bay Area transit organization, and implemented them in the Open API spec, with brief instructions for authentication and brief reference information.  

The content is located in a YAML file and is hosted on SmartBear's Swaggerhub website.  

This demo was created by me without the assistance of anyone at 511.org.
