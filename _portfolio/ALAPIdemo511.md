title: "API documentation demo"
---

A demonstration of REST API documentation and publishing using the Open API v3.0 spec. 

This [demonstration](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/bennetthub500/default-title/0.1) in Swaggerhub brings an under-documented public API up to current standards for API docs.  The try-it functionality allows the reader to make API calls and view the response. I took three endpoints from the API of 511.org, a San Francisco Bay Area transit organization, and implemented them in the Open API spec, with an abbreviated developer guide or quick start, procedural instructions for authentication and reference information.  

There is also a better reading experience in a 3-panel [Stoplight version](https://bennett-charles.stoplight.io/docs/511api-demo/branches/main/mfrt8ye1a09uh-using-the-511-org-api) without the live try-it feature.   

My current API documentation experience is with material covered by an NDA that can't be shared. 

**Note:** This demo was created by me without the assistance of any subject matter experts at 511.org.
