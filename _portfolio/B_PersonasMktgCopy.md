Campaign landing pages copy 

Here are two landing pages for Personas, a B2B sales automation platform that targets startups. Personas uses Hubspot. 

The audience for the [first piece](https://github.com/bennetthub500/personal/blob/master/assets/images/PersonasFoundersLanding.pdf) is founders and heads of sales, and the [second piece](https://github.com/bennetthub500/personal/blob/master/assets/images/PersonasMktgLanding.pdf) is aimed at marketing leads.   
The stylistic goals for both were brevity, with punchy language, a crisp definition of benefits and deliberate repetition.
