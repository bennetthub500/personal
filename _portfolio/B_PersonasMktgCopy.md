Copywriting - Hubspot-hosted marketing campaign landing pages targeting sales and marketing leaders

**Company context:** Personas, an early-stage B2B sales automation startup. 

**Process for these documents:** I wrote copy for two landing pages, collaborating on messaging with the co-founder and product lead.

**Audience:** The audience for the [first piece](https://bennetthub500.github.io/personal/pdfs/PersonasFoundersLanding2.pdf) is founders and heads of sales, and the [second piece](https://bennetthub500.github.io/personal/pdfs/PersonasMktgLanding3.pdf) is aimed at marketing leads.  

The stylistic goals for both were brevity, with punchy language, a crisp definition of benefits and deliberate repetition.  The primary message goals was to emphasize ease-of-use and effectiveness.
