**Project context:** As a technical writer on Amazonâ€™s Developer Experience team on a 3-month contract, I was tasked with rewriting multiple onboarding and API docs.

**Problems to solve:** The previous Postman runbook had several outdated configuraton details, and did not guide readers through the non-intuitive steps in the Postman UI.  The reader needed to be instructed to choose the right Postman product and understand the security issues with using the cloud product.  

**Process for this document:**  I tried all steps to look for points of confusion, and as a result made extensive use of screenshots.  I removed unnecessary reference-style information.

**Audience:** The audiences for the onboarding docs are internal Amazon engineers and third party developers.
