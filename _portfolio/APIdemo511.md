title: "API documentation demo"
---

This is a demonstration of REST API documentation and publishing for public transit data using the Open API v3.0 spec. 

The [demonstration](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/bennetthub500/511v2/1.0.0) allows the reader to make API calls and view the response on a web page. I took two endpoints from the API of 511.org, a San Francisco Bay Area transit organization, and implemented them in the Open API spec, with brief instructions for authentication and brief reference information.  

My current API documentation experience is with material covered by an NDA that can't be shared. I created this abbreviated demo to provide an approximation of my understanding of API material. 

**Note:** Detailed information re: the full range of parameters, responses, error messages, etc. is not included.  The content is located in a YAML file and is hosted on SmartBear's Swaggerhub website.  This demo was created by me without the assistance of anyone at 511.org.
