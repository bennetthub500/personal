REST API documentation and publishing using the Open API v3.0 spec 

My REST API documentation experience is with material covered by NDA's. Here are two versions of a self-created API docs sample utilizing the Open API spec:

1) [Stoplight](https://bennett-charles.stoplight.io/docs/511api-demo/branches/main/mfrt8ye1a09uh-using-the-511-org-api), with a more-readable, contemporary 3-panel design.

2) [Swaggerhub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/bennetthub500/default-title/0.1), an older interface design with a working Try-it feature where the reader can make a live API call.

- This API example brings an under-documented public API up to current standards for API docs. 
- I implemented three endpoints in the OpenAPI spec from the API of 511.org, a San Francisco Bay Area transit organization. 
- I created an abbreviated developer guide or quick start with code samples, procedural instructions and some partial reference content.

**Note:** This demo was created by me without the assistance of any subject matter experts at 511.org.
