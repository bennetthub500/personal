I write for a broad range of audiences, including developers, users, and customers. I love working across teams, including sales, product, design, UX, marketing, engineering.  My obsession with detail and process is a great fit with engineers. 

I write with a task-oriented, user-centric approach.  I love the challenge of demystifying complexity. 

My non-writing experience helps me do my job better. I have managed customer-to-product team feedback loop, drove input to roadmap, performed customer development interviews, and developed user journeys and prototypes.
