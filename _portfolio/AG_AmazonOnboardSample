**Project context:** As a technical writer on Amazonâ€™s Developer Experience team on a 3-month contract, I was tasked with rewriting multiple onboarding docs, GraphQL getting started docs, and GraphQL reference.  

**Problems to solve:** Onboarding for internal devs often took 2 or 3 entire days.  Most GraphQL fields had no descriptions at all. The team never had a technical writer, and existing docs were written by multiple engineers, utilized inconsistent style, and were frequently out-of-date, missing product changes and deprecations. 

**Process for this document:**  I onboarded myself, logged all friction, and collaborated closely with an engineer and other team members to create a new sequence of installation and authentication steps.  The rewritten doc resulted in an immediate reduction in blockers and support tickets. 

Issues addressed:
- Removed outdated/incorrect content
- Rewrote headings considering inclusion in right-nav 
- Broke up overlong paragraphs, added numbered or bulleted steps when appropriate
- Added or modified code samples and processes as needed, such as adding scripts, collaborating with engineer
- Copyedits to remaining content

**Audience and problems to solve:** The audiences for the onboarding docs are internal Amazon engineers and third party developers.
