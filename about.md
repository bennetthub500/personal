I write for a broad range of audiences, including developers, users, and customers. I love working across teams, including sales, product, design, UX, marketing, engineering.  

My approach is always task-oriented and user-centric.  I love the challenge of demystifying complexity, and have an obsession with detail and process that is a great fit with engineers.  

My non-writing experience helps me do my job better. I have managed the customer-to-product team feedback loop, performed customer development interviews, and co-developed user journeys and prototypes.
